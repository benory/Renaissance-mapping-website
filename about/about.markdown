The Renaissance lies scattered before us. For more than 200 years, scholars in disciplines ranging from art history and literature to political history, geography, and music have collected and catalogued vast amounts of information&mdash;but many of the most crucial documents are buried in undigitized publications not easily accessible to specialists in one field, let alone to their colleagues in another.

**Mapping the Musical Renaissance** moves outward from fundamental histories in order to uncover connections among seemingly unrelated people and events. For now our work focuses on musicians from the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. As the project develops, the map will expand to include artists, writers, political rulers, and other central figures. The project allows users to explore intersections between heterogeneous types of information while giving access to primary documents that underpin that information. <br><br>

### Project History

This is a new project. A 2022 grant from the [France–UC Berkeley fund](https://fbf.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} allowed us to form an international team of students and scholars and develop these ideas. We identified a core data set centered on musicians active in the years around 1500, above all the towering figure Josquin des Prez (1450–1521). Using Josquin’s world as our center of gravity, we developed an organizational scheme and workflow for data entry. 

A 2024 [Stanford Humanities Seed Grant](https://publichumanities.stanford.edu/research-grants/humanities-seed-grants){:target="_blank"} has enabled us to build our mapping tool and expand our database. At present we have more than 3,500 events, ranging from letters by Ferrarese scribes to French royal chapel paylists to secondary literature describing [how one particular singer in Bruges was fired owing to his laziness, disobediance, and downright incompetence](../?eventid=03296).<br><br>
